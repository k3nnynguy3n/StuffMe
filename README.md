# StuffMe

Class project for CPSC3300 - Databases!
Completed the project throughout the quarter, and done with two other classmates. 

StuffMe is a recipe database, where users are able to do the following: 
- Upload recipes with photos and descriptions
- Edit or delete recipe posts
- Comment and rate other users' recipes
- Search for a recipe, ingredient(s) using queries

* Most functionalities above work, given the limited time we made what we could! *
